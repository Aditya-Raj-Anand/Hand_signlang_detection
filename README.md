**Sign Language Detection**


This project is based on hand sign language detection system. It utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize hand gestures and translate them into text.



**Features**



  1) Real-time hand sign detection
  2) Improved model accuracy
  3) Optimized for better performance




**Requirements**


  1) Python 3.x

  2) OpenCV

  3) NumPy

  4) Mediapipe


**üõ†Ô∏è How It Works**



  i) MediaPipe Hands detects and tracks hand landmarks.

  ii) The program analyzes finger positions to classify hand gestures.

  iii) The recognized gesture is mapped to a corresponding sign language word.
